## Django SSO using Azure and Microsoft Graph

This is a simple project applying SSO in a django project. I'm going to use Oauth2 and SAML to configure SSO, the provider to use is Azure and Microsoft Graph to get the information for a one user registered in an AD.

Also, I'm playing with different roles created inside the application in Azure domain.

Tasks to do during this project:

- [ ] Created a project.
- [ ] Configure an environment and install the lib necessaries.
